# fake-atc-ticket
This html page acts like a fake digital ticket for the ATCesercizio buses in La Spezia, Italy.

## Usage
This can be used either locally or online, by accessing the [repo's site](https://conordop.github.io/fake-atc-ticket/)
or just double clicking the index.html file.

### Using the fake messaging app
It is possible to use the fake messaging site (messaging.html) to fake the original text from ATC.
